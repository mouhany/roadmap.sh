  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between == and ===?",
    answer:
      "== checks for equality with type coercion, while === checks for strict equality without type coercion.",

  {
    question: "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "A closure is a function that remembers and accesses variables from its outer scope, even when the outer function has finished executing.",

    question: "What is an event in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "An event is an action or occurrence, such as a click, hover, or keypress, that JavaScript can respond to.",

    question: "What is an IIFE?",
    answer:
      "An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between var, let, and const?",
    answer:
      "'var' has function scope, 'let' and 'const' have block scope. 'const' is used for variables that should not be reassigned.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are promises in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of the 'this' keyword?",
    answer:
      "The 'this' keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is hoisting in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are arrow functions?",
    answer:
      "Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript and do not have their own 'this' binding.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between null and undefined?",
    answer:
      "'null' represents the intentional absence of any object value, while 'undefined' indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.",

  {
    question: "What are JavaScript modules?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript modules allow developers to split code into separate files that can be imported and exported for better organization and reuse.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a callback function?",
    answer:
      "A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?",
    answer:
      "Synchronous code is executed line by line, while asynchronous code allows tasks to run in the background without blocking subsequent code.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the event loop?",
    answer:
      "The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles the execution of multiple operations by managing the call stack and the message queue.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of the async/await syntax?",
    answer:
      "The async/await syntax simplifies writing asynchronous code, making it look like synchronous code while handling promises.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?",
    answer:
      "A shallow copy copies the object's reference, while a deep copy duplicates the object and all objects it references.",
